In the era of [cloud-native](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition) world we
cannot stick to a particular framework, however due to projects requirement we often need to evolve the existing testing
solution in such a way so that it can cater multiple testing requirement,
hence [HybridTestFramework](https://github.com/dipjyotimetia/HybridTestFramework) is targeting to create a bridge
between the kind of legacy systems
or the systems which are still in a transition phase of migrate to cloud with super cool cloud-native systems.
Ita comprehensive and versatile testing framework designed to cover various aspects of software testing.
Its purpose is to help developers and testers streamline their testing process and ensure the highest quality in their
applications.

```

### Write your first user journey

Create new class and name as the TC00*_E2E_TEST-***

- Provide jira link in @Link
- Provide all the api components as @Feature
- Provide test severity and description
- Write test
- Use CatchBlock in try/catch section

### Spin-up chrome, firefox, selenium hub and OWASP proxy server

```shell script
docker-compose up -d
```

### Complete infrastructure creation for local run

```shell script
docker-compose -f docker-compose-infra up -d
```

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.5.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
kubectl proxy
kubectl describe secret -n kube-system | grep deployment -A 12
## To delete deployments
